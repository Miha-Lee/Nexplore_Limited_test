 Nexplore Limited Test Setup Guide

 Frontend: React, Typescript, Vite, Ant Design
 Backend: Express, Node, Postgres, Typescript
 Test: Jest

 Small reminder: Before we start the frontend project, I prefer we start the backend server first, otherwise, 
 there will be some exceptions at the frontend, which will affect the Fetching todo items or Unit Test. 

 Backend Setup Guide:
 1. We need to go to the backend folder, and locate to the sql folder, inside the folder, you are able to see the "todo.sql" file, 
    which we will copy to pgadmin and execute the query.
